Mama Papa and Soma Kijana are the voices of my mother.</p></td>

                        Chimano says: “I met Sauti Sol members individually in three different scenarios. And it’s the dynamics of how we all came together as a band that still baffle me irrespective of the fact that three of us were in the same high school. It was pure serendipity that despite different career dreams, music brought us together in a way inexplicable.”</p></td>
